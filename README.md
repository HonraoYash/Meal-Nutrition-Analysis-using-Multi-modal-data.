# Meal-Nutrition-Analysis-using-Multi-modal-data.
This study analyses multimodal data consisting of Continuous Glucose Monitor readings, demographic data of BMI, Insulin levels, diabetes status, etc, and Images of Breakfast and Lunch meals. The labels consist of Breakfast calories, carbs, fats and proteins. We developed an ML model to predict the lunch calories, carbs, fats and protein.

Abstract - 
—This study presents a novel multimodal deep learning approach for predicting calorie intake using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, demographic information and meal images. We have implemented a comprehensive model that is integrating convolutional neural networks for image processing, bidirectional long-short term memory networks with attention mechanisms for CGM data analysis, and fully connected layers
 for demographic features. The model architecture is incorporating residual connections and dropout layers for enhancing performance and prevent overfitting. We have implemented a systematic hyperparameter tuning process using grid search to optimize the model’s configuration. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through various performance metrics, with the best model achieving a Root Mean Square Relative
 Error (RMSRE) of 0.35. This research contributes to the field of personalized nutrition by leveraging diverse data sources and advanced machine learning techniques, offering potential applications in dietary management and health monitoring.
